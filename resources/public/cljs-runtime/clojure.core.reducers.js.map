The collection is partitioned into groups of approximately\n  n (default 512), each of which is reduced with reducef (with a seed\n  value obtained by calling (combinef) with no arguments). The results\n  of these reductions are then reduced with combinef (default\n  reducef). combinef must be associative, and, when called with no\n  arguments, (combinef) must produce its identity element.

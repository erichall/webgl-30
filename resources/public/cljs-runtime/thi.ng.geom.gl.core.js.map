position & color for 3 vertices\n;; - 1 index buffer defining a single triangle (optional)\n;; - number of indices (only required if :indices given)\n;; - number of vertices\n;; - GL draw mode\n;;\n;; ```\n;; {:attribs      {:position {:data (native/float-buffer [0 0 0,   1 0 0,   0 1 0])   :size 3}\n;;                 :color    {:data (native/float-buffer [1 0 0 1, 0 1 0 1, 0 0 1 1]) :size 4}}\n;;
